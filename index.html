            <p>"Terrorism is the unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government or its citizens to further certain political or social objectives."<br>
            The visualisation below explores the impact of terrorism around the world using the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) collected by the Pinkerton Global Intelligence Service (PGIS). GTB documents more than 190k international and domestic terrorist attacks that occured worldwide since 1970.<br>

                <h4>Global Terrorism Index</h4>
                <p> The map shows the impact of terrorism around the world.<br>
                    As per the 2017 GTI results, the top five countries with the highest impact from terrorism are Afghanistan, 
                    Nigeria, Syria, Pakistan and Iraq. These five countries accounted for three quarters of all deaths from terrorism in 2016.<br>
                    Data shows us that terrorism in these countries increased significantly after the US 9/11 attacks.
                    While the media sensaitonalises terorrist activities in US, truth of the matter is that since 2002 (post 9/11) 
                    eight of the nine regions of the world experienced an increase in Terrorism. In fact, North America was the only region 
                    to experience a reduced impact; with the Muslim regions of the world being the most impacted.
                    In contrast, countries like Mongolia, Papua New Guinea had GTI score of 0.

                <h4>Aftermath of the 9/11 Attack</h4>
                <p>Pre 9/11 is the time period between 1991 to 2001; post 9/11 is the time period between 2002 to 2012.<br>
                    The graph to the right shows the top 10 countries that had the most number of terrorist attacks after 9/11. It is evident from the data that
                    Iraq experienced a massive surge in terrorist attacks post 9/11, followed by Afghanistan and consequently its neighbour Pakistan. There were little to almost no changes in 
                    countries such as United States, Turkey and France.<br>
            The September 11 attacks transformed the political and military operations of the US on the countries it accused of being terorrists or of sheltering 
            them.

                <h4>Weapons Used in Terrorist Attacks</h4>
                <p>Throughout history, terrorists seem to be attached to bombs more than any other type of weapons. A plausible explanation would be that
                    explosives have a metaphorical meaning - a blow delivered. "Suicide bombs are even more effective because they present no immediate 
                    target for retributive justice, which can create political pressure for the victim country to engage in excessive or futile punitive 
                    military actions; this is often the very goal of the attack. With gunman attacks, the response and the hunting-down of the gunmen 
                    is itself a satisfying act of retribution, and that satisfaction can blunt the target nation's willingness to get involved." <br><i>(Source: Why do 
                    terrorists prefer bombs?. The Economist)</i>

                <h4>Most Fatal Terrorist Attacks in History</h4>
                <p>The graph on the right shows the most fatal terrorist attacks in the last half century. Here, fatality is related to the number of deaths the
                    attack caused.<br>
                    The 9/11 attacks, Baga Massacre and Camp Speicher Massacre have been three of the most fatal terrorist attacks in history, occuring between 2001 and
                    2015.
