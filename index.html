                <h4>Global Terrorism Index</h4>
                <p> The map shows the impact of terrorism around the world.<br>
                    As per the 2017 GTI results, the top five countries with the highest impact from terrorism are Afghanistan, 
                    Nigeria, Syria, Pakistan and Iraq. These five countries accounted for three quarters of all deaths from terrorism in 2016. 
                    In contrast, countries like Mongolia, Papua New Guinea had GTI score of 0.<br>
                    While the media sensaitonalises terorrist activities in US, truth of the matter is that since 2002 (post 9/11) 
                    eight of the nine regions of the world experienced an increase in Terrorism. In fact, North America was the only region 
                    to experience a reduced impact; with the Muslim regions of the world being the most impacted.

                <h4>Aftermath of the 9/11 Attack</h4>
                <p>Pre 9/11 is the time period between 1991 to 2001; post 9/11 is the time period between 2002 to 2012.<br>
                    The graph to the right shows the top 10 countries that had the most number of terrorist attacks after 9/11. It is evident from the data that
                    Iraq experienced a massive surge in terrorist attacks post 9/11, followed by Afghanistan and consequently its neighbour Pakistan. There were little to almost no changes in 
                    countries such as United States, Turkey and France.<br>
            The September 11 attacks transformed the political and military operations of the US on the countries it accused of being terorrists or of sheltering 
            them.
